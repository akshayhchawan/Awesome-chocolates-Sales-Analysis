**Chocolate Sales Analytics**

**Situation:**
Awesome Chocolates operates in six countries worldwide but faces challenges in tracking key sales metrics, salesperson performance, and product performance. The company aims to identify demand patterns, month-over-month growth trends, and implement data-driven strategies to boost sales and growth.

**Task:**
The goal was to design a dashboard to monitor key metrics such as sales, costs, and profits. This included analyzing insights like identifying top-performing salespeople, best-selling products, and determining which countries perform better. Additionally, the task involved evaluating if the business met profit targets and identifying opportunities to reduce costs.

**Action:**
Raw data was imported from Excel into Power BI, where it was cleaned and transformed for analysis. Using Power BI visuals, such as cards, column charts, tables, and slicers, the data was converted into meaningful visuals. A dynamic dashboard was created to track all key metrics month-over-month in a single interface.

**Result:** 
1.	Identified the sales characteristics of top performers and recommended implementing these strategies for underperforming salespeople to enhance their performance.
2.	Proposed a plan to increase sales by discontinuing poor-performing products and using saved cost for top selling products production and marketing..
3.	Suggested a strategy to reduce the number of shipments, resulting in a cost savings.
